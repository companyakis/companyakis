I like Python, JavaScript, Vyper (not Solidity) and Haskell... And I should love Rust&Move... And Dart (When?..)?

Once upon a time, I was a bank auditor. 

I'm not a computer engineer! But I believe I am the person who can build a bridge between financial world and programming languages... 

I'll do my best!
