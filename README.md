I like Python, JavaScript, Solidity and Haskell... And and Mojo!.. Mojo? Rust? No:( I know, Rust is a strong soldier, but I think Mojo will be game-changer.

Once upon a time, I was a bank auditor. 

I'm not a computer engineer! But I believe I am the person who can build a bridge between financial world and programming languages... 

I'll do my best!
